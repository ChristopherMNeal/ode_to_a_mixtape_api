# README
## Description
This is a project to scrape playlists from radio stations and store them in a database.
The goal is to have a database of playlists that can be queried to find out what songs were played on a given day,
or to find out what songs were played on a given station.

## Setup
start docker
`be docker-compose up -d`
set up the db
`be rake db:setup` create, load the schema and seed data into the database
Seeding is important to load the station(s)
run `bundle exec whenever --update-crontab` to create cronjobs to load the data
scrape broadcast titles for stations:
`be rake scrape:broadcast_titles STATION_ID=1`

## TO DO
[ ] Finish implementing Normalizable (see below)
[ ] Troubleshoot cronjobs and scheduler gem
[X] add fuzzy finder concern
[ ] implement fuzzy finder for artists, songs, albums, playlists, broadcasts, stations, record labels, genres
[ ] Create export to merge names in bulk
[ ] Add station timezone to stations table
  [ ] Factor in timezone when calculating air time
[ ] add broadcast first and last air date to broadcasts table
[x] scrape the broadcasts in chronological order to sort the IDs
[ ] create (or find!) a music dates API to check dates for music history events relevant to radio playlists
  - Maybe add ability to search by specific date (with year) or by month and day for any year and see playlists for that date
  - This would be for searching for non-holiday events. Adding a separate column for holidays.
  - It would also be nice to cross reference with a music history API to see what happened in music history on a playlist's air date.
  - Creating a music history calendar feels like a big undertaking that would quickly snowball. First I'll look in to these:
    - [ ] https://www.onthisday.com/music
    - [ ] https://www.thisdayinmusic.com/
    - [ ] https://www.songfacts.com/
    - [ ] https://www.musicvf.com/
    - [ ] https://www.music-map.com/
  - looking for:
    - album release dates
    - artist birthdays
    - artist death dates
[ ] also incorporate my previous logic for finding the playlists from the x week of a given month.
[ ] it might also be nice to create a calendar specific to each station
  [ ] station first broadcast/anniversary date
  [X] fund drives
  [ ] special events
[ ] Would it make sense to do the same for broadcasts?
    - first broadcast date and anniversary
    - ...special events?

### Future Normalizable Steps

Normalizable is implemented for Artists. Need to add to the following models.
Normalized columns and uniqueness indexes are already added to these:
- [ ] Album
- [ ] Broadcast
- [ ] Genre
- [ ] Playlist
- [ ] RecordLabel
- [ ] Song

#### Add to other normalized class models
For example:
```ruby
class Song < ApplicationRecord
  include Normalizable

  normalize_column :title, :normalized_title
end
```

#### Update queries to use normalized columns
```ruby
normalized_input = Normalizable.normalize_text("BeyoncÃ©")
artist = Artist.find_by(normalized_name: normalized_input)
```

#### Correct data
Current data is not normalized. Some records will be invalid.
Need to create a `normalize_all` rake task to run `merge_duplicate_records` on each model.
If making changes to the Normalizable module, will need to do this again.

## DB Design
This is a bit out of date. I need to update it to reflect the current schema.
